# stochastic-patterns
Python codes for simulating stochastic reaction diffusion systems and random reaction diffusion systems.

Program currently runs from a single python Script. Future versions will be split across multiple modules, with a single main.py used to run the simulaiton. Analysis of results will be dealt with in a seperate module.
